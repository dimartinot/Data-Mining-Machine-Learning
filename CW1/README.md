# Data Mining & Machine Learning: Assessment 1

## Bayesian Learning and Clustering

Data preparation and analysis, confusion matrices, correlation and feature selection are all important in realworld machine learning tasks. Data clustering and probabilistic data analysis are two core sets of methods in
data mining and machine learning.

For this assessment we have worked with the a dataset sample from Stallkamp et al's *German Street Sign Recognition Benchmark* which consists of:
 - 10 classes
 - 12660 images (converted in grey-scale with pixel values ranging from 0 to 255 abd rescaled to 48*48px)
 
 The 10 labels to predict were:
 
  0. **speed limit 60**
  1. **speed limit 80**
  2. **speed limit 80 lifted**
  3. **right of way at crossing**
  4. **right of way in general**
  5. **give way**
  6. **stop**
  7. **no speed limit general**
  8. **turn right down**
  9. **turn left down**
  
  Our objectives were to compare performances of Bayesian methods and clustering methods while, at the same time, preprocessing the dataset as much as possible with scaling or regularization procedures.
  Our results are displayed in our jupyter notebooks. 
  
  Furthermore, we undertook the completion of a research question where we built a hierarchy of bayes nets model with the inspiration of the ImageNet dataset architecture with different level of classes.
