# Data Mining & Machine Learning: Assessment 1

## Bayesian Learning and Clustering

Data preparation and analysis, confusion matrices, correlation and feature selection are all important in realworld machine learning tasks. Data clustering and probabilistic data analysis are two core sets of methods in
data mining and machine learning.

---

  Our objectives were to compare performances of Bayesian methods and clustering methods while, at the same time, preprocessing the dataset as much as possible with scaling or regularization procedures.
  Our results are displayed in our jupyter notebooks. 
  
  Furthermore, we undertook the completion of a research question where we built a hierarchy of bayes nets model with the inspiration of the ImageNet dataset architecture with different level of classes.
