# Data-Mining-Machine-Learning
This project contains all the code developed for the courseworks of the Data Mining & Machine Learning class of Heriot Watt University as a part of the Master program. 

## Team

This represents the work of 4 master students:
 - Dimitri Accad (MSc in Artificial intelligence)
 - Antoine Auzimour (MSc in Artificial intelligence)
 - Clarence Deltel (MSc in Artificial intelligence)
 - Thomas Di Martino (MSc in Artificial intelligence with Speech & Multimodal Interaction)
 
## Courseworks details

 Split in two courseworks, the first one was focusing on bayesian learning as well as unsupervised learning while the second one was more about decision tress/ensembling techniques as well as Deep Neural Networks (MLPs & CNNs).

## Dataset
For this assessment we have worked with the a dataset sample from Stallkamp et al's *German Street Sign Recognition Benchmark* which consists of:
 - 10 classes
 - 12660 images (converted in grey-scale with pixel values ranging from 0 to 255 abd rescaled to 48*48px)
 
 The 10 labels to predict were:
 
  0. **speed limit 60**
  1. **speed limit 80**
  2. **speed limit 80 lifted**
  3. **right of way at crossing**
  4. **right of way in general**
  5. **give way**
  6. **stop**
  7. **no speed limit general**
  8. **turn right down**
  9. **turn left down**
